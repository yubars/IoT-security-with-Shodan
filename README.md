# IoT-security-with-Shodan
In this project, First we find vulnerable IoT device category.  
We also observe the abuse of IoT devices in underground markets and their evasion techniques to exploit vulnerable devices.
Then we explore these dives spreadness across the internet leveraging Shodan.
Finally, we see IoT security ecosystem and evaluate the gap.
